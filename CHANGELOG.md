## Added new /slashcommands! 
The slashcommand system is still a WIP, i will add aliases to command as i improve it in a later update!
Here are the new /slashcommands:
- `/bettertransmog` or `/bettertransmog settings` (opens settings panel)
- `/bettertransmog outfits` (Opens the outfit swapping panel)
- `/bettertransmog changelog` (Opens the changelog panel)

Expect improvements to slashcommands in the next update so you can alias `/bettertransmog` to `/bt`
